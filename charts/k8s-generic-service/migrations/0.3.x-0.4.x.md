# Migrating from 0.3.x to 0.4.x

## Version 0.4.0
- Introduced a health check adapter for GRPC services. This allows another container to be spun up in the pod that connects to a [GRPC Health check endpoint](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/health/grpc_health_v1) registered with the running server. This requires code modifications to serve this new endpoint.

In order to migrate to the new version please update the following sections of your `values.yml`:

## Version 0.4.1
- Re-added specifying the Container Port for `service.yaml` ports. If no `containerPort` value is setup, it defaults to the `port` value.

## Version 0.4.2
- Added the ability to specify the JDBC database type on the JDBC URL for Flyway Migrations.

## Version 0.4.3
- Added the ability to disable a service via "service.enabled=true/false".

## Version 0.4.4
- Added the ability to separately override the URIs for the liveness and readiness k8s health endpoints.

#### Chart Modifications
There is now a `flyway.databaseType` value, specify the JDBC URL database name. For example, `postgresql`, `mysql`, `sqlserver`.
If it is omitted, it will default to `mysql`.
