# Migrating from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

Version 0.2 has introduced multiple service port capabilities and that caused some breaking changes. In order to migrate to the new version please update the following sections of your `values.yml`:

```
service:
  port: 80
  containerPort: 50000
```

becomes

```
service:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      containerPort: 5000
      name: myservicePort
      protocol: TCP
```

Add a port section to your ingress:

```
ingress:
  ...
  port: 80

```

Add a port name section to your monitoring:
```
monitoring:
  port: myServicePort
```

After completing these 3 changes, pin your helm chart version to `~0.2.0`
